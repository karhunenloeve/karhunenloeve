# ðŸ“— [Curriculum vitae](https://karhunenloeve.github.io/CurriculumVitae/curriculumVitae.pdf)
Iâ€™m lume, and if thereâ€™s a problem that needs solvingâ€”be it in mathematics, computer science, or teaching someone to survive Topologyâ€”Iâ€™m the person people call. Whether itâ€™s bridging algebraic topology with cutting-edge machine learning or guiding students through the labyrinth of advanced mathematics, I thrive where complexity meets curiosity.

My professional playgrounds have ranged from research labs and lecture halls to industries that trust neural networks more than people. Iâ€™ve published on topics like persistent homology and neural network dimensionality in venues like Springer Lecture Notes, worked on signal classification that powers real-world systems, and even taught seminars that turn abstract theories into tools people can actually use. Python, TensorFlow, CUDAâ€”these are not just tools; theyâ€™re languages I speak fluently, alongside German, English, and Italian. And while the academic world is my arena, teaching is where the real fun happens. Whether itâ€™s helping a high school student nail their Abitur or lecturing on the finer points of algebraic persistence, Iâ€™ve built a career on making the impossible not just possible, but engaging. If it involves a whiteboard, a question, and a few nervous laughs from the audience, youâ€™ll find me at home. Outside work, Iâ€™m a functional training enthusiast and a self-taught chef, which means I approach fitness and cooking the same way I approach mathematicsâ€”with precision, experimentation, and just enough chaos to keep things interesting. Give me a challenge, and Iâ€™ll give you a solution, minus the fluff and full of flair.

# What I did
I hold a Bachelor of Arts degree in German Philology from the [UniversitÃ¤t Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/), having written the thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. phil. Paul RÃ¶ssler](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/sprache-literatur-kultur/germanistik-sw-1/roessler/) and having studied in the scope of which German and Italian Philology, Media Informatics and Information Science as major fans. I have received my Master of Arts degree in Information Science, having written [the thesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.09108.pdf) at the [Institute of Biophysics and Physical Biochemistry](http://www-aglang.uni-regensburg.de/) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. rer. nat. Elmar Lang](http://www-aglang.uni-regensburg.de/). I worked in the field of Evolutionary Data Management as a research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. Dr.-Ing. Richard Lenz](https://www.cs6.tf.fau.de/person/richard-lenz/). I hold also a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics, having studied Computer Science in the scope of which as a minor fan, from [Friedrich-Alexander UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/), having written the [thesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08323) under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Kang Li](https://sites.google.com/site/kanglishomepage/) at the [Chair for Lie Groups and Representation Theory](https://en.www.math.fau.de/lie-groups/scientific-staff/prof-dr-karl-hermann-neeb/). Currently, I pursue my Master of Science degree in Mathematics at the [Friedrich-Alexander UniversitÃ¤t Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg](https://math.fau.de).

# Social
I use some of the scientific social networking opportunities. If you'd like to read my CV, please click the link in the repositorie's description or use [this one](https://karhunenloeve.github.io/CurriculumVitae/curriculumVitae.pdf). My papers are always uploaded to arXiv, thus I'll include it here as a schedule of my current and of course future work. The following list is conclusive:
